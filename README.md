*What's For Dinner?* was a fun side project made primarily for personal use after getting tired of sitting in agony when I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner and needed some inspiration. This web app allows users to narrow done their dinner ideas by cuisine and/or protein. Users can also hit the *Let's Eat* button for a truly random dinner idea. 

My main focus for this app was writing cleaner CSS and making something that was responsive without having to write a bunch of media queries. I also wanted a shot at creating my own little API.

* Adding links to recipes for each item

* Adding a fun animation before the dinner idea is generated. 
* Adding more entrees and sides!
